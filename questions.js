            correctAnswer: "God",

            correctAnswer: "Because of His love",
            explanation: "From the very beginning, God's actions were motivated by His love. He created humans to have a relationship with Him, and even when they sinned and broke that relationship, He made a way for reconciliation. The ultimate demonstration of God's love was sending Jesus to die for humanity's sins, offering forgiveness and eternal life. Jesus' death and resurrection were God's most powerful expressions of love, proving that He desires to restore the broken relationship and bring people into His eternal family."
